# What It Does #
The code accepts incoming commands via telnet or voice recognition, then it sends the commands out to a robot device. It is essentially an API for using a cellphone to control a robot.

Highlighted functionality includes:
  * **Voice recognition** to speak to your robot
  * **Text-to-speech** so your robot can speak back
  * **Compass orientation** to point North, East, South, West, or any degree in between
  * **Remote control** commands for forward, back, left, right, and stop
  * **Audio recoding** to use the phone's mic to record sounds
  * **GPS** to acquire the phone's location and speak the city and state
  * **XMPP Chat** to send chat commands to the robot

# Why use cellphones for robots? #
By using cheap electronic components such as Arduino boards, you can pair them with your $400 phone to make an awesome robot. It would cost hundreds of dollars to add GPS, LCD's, motion sensors, wi-fi, cellular connections, speakers, and more to a hobby bot, but your phone already has these!
